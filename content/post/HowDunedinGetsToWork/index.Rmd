I recently participated in the [There and Back Again](https://www.stats.govt.nz/2018-census/there-and-back-again-data-visualisation-competition) data visualisation competition from [Stats NZ](https://www.stats.govt.nz/).  I wanted to quickly make a post to feature the app I made, called [How Dunedin Gets to Work](https://campbead.shinyapps.io/HowDunedinGetsToWork/).  This project is meant to be a lightweight app to quickly visualise the modes of transportation people of Dunedin, NZ use to get to work.  I used Leaflet for the mapping components and created the app using R-Shiny.  Source code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/campbead/HowDunedinGetsToWork).
