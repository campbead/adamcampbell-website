<p>I recently participated in the <a href="https://www.stats.govt.nz/2018-census/there-and-back-again-data-visualisation-competition">There and Back Again</a> data visualisation competition from <a href="https://www.stats.govt.nz/">Stats NZ</a>. I wanted to quickly make a post to feature the app I made, called <a href="https://campbead.shinyapps.io/HowDunedinGetsToWork/">How Dunedin Gets to Work</a>. This project is meant to be a lightweight app to quickly visualise the modes of transportation people of Dunedin, NZ use to get to work. I used Leaflet for the mapping components and created the app using R-Shiny. Source code for this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/campbead/HowDunedinGetsToWork">GitHub</a>.</p>
