<p>I make beer as a hobby. It’s something I’ve been doing for over a decade and throughout the years my beer has improved dramatically. One thing that I really like about beer making is the mathematical detail involved. Recipes are precise to reach certain targets. There are thousands of different ingredients and just as may different ways to use them.</p>
